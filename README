My first game in Haskell
========================

SUMMER! that magic time when you can go to the beach and do basically nothing

instead you're stuck in your room learning Haskell

FML <3

THE GAME
--------

the game picks a number from 0 to 100, you say "u" up (x >= 50) or "d" down (x < 50)
guess it right 5 times in a row and you ARE FUCKED UP LIKE ME GO TO THE BEACH IS SUMMER FOR FUCKSAKE

How to compile
--------------

ghc --make main.hs
